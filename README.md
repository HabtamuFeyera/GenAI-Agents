# **GenAI-Agents** üöÄ

Welcome to **GenAI-Agents** ‚Äî a repository dedicated to creating and deploying powerful AI agents powered by **Generative AI**. This project leverages **OpenAI's GPT-4** model to perform specific tasks, such as answering questions, performing calculations, and retrieving information from external sources, including **Wikipedia** and various blogs. Each agent is designed to handle a specific action within a loop, including **Thought**, **Action**, **PAUSE**, and **Observation**, enabling dynamic, intelligent behavior.

## üåü **Features**

- **AI ChatBot Agent**: Uses GPT-4 to answer questions, run calculations, and search for relevant content on the internet.
- **Wikipedia Search Agent**: Retrieves summaries and information from Wikipedia for any given query.
- **Blog Search Agent**: Searches and retrieves blog posts relevant to the user's query.
- **Calculation Agent**: Safely evaluates and returns mathematical expressions.

## üîß **System Architecture**

The **GenAI-Agents** system is structured around a thought-action loop, ensuring continuous improvement in the reasoning process:

- **Thought**: Describes the agent's reasoning for solving a user‚Äôs question.
- **Action**: Executes specific actions (e.g., querying Wikipedia, performing calculations, etc.).
- **PAUSE**: The agent pauses after performing an action to await further results.
- **Observation**: After the action is completed, the agent outputs the result as an answer.

Each agent is designed to execute one of these tasks based on user input and return a refined answer through this loop.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Python 3.x** installed.
2. **Streamlit** for creating the user interface.
3. **OpenAI API Key**: Set your OpenAI API key in your environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### **Installation**

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HabtamuFeyera/GenAI-Agents.git
cd GenAI-Agents
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Running the Application**

To run the application locally, execute the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the app in your browser, and you can start interacting with the agents through the **Streamlit** interface.
